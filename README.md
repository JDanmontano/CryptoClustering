# CryptoClustering

This project uses machine learning to analyze and group cryptocurrencies based on their market behavior. The main steps are:

Prepare and Analyze the Data: First, we normalize the cryptocurrency data and visualize its features to get a better understanding.

Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means: We use K-means clustering to group cryptocurrencies into natural clusters. The best number of clusters, "k," is determined using the elbow method.

Improve Clustering with PCA: We apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to simplify the data by reducing the number of features while keeping important information. Then, we run the clustering again to see how this affects the results.

Overall, the project aims to identify patterns in the cryptocurrency market and see how reducing data complexity impacts clustering accuracy.
